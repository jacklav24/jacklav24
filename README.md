- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jacklav24
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science, Mathematics, and Statistics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently building full-stack ML apps (FastAPI + React), doing in-depth data analysis with Python and pandas, and exploring clustering, recommendation systems, and sports analytics

### Things I have experience with (so far):
- Java
- Python
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- R
- Full Stack Development
- And a lot more!

## Projects you should check out
### NBA Player Predictor
- My most current and fleshed out project.
- This is a system which takes a player's game logs, merged with opposing teams' defensive stats, to train a few machine learning models and make predictions for point totals.
- Just recently, I've built it from a simple jupyter notebook into a full stack application, with React frontend, and FastAPI python backend!

### Unpopular Music Matcher
- A Jupyter notebook project using KMeans, and PCA dimensionality reduction.
- Recommends songs similar to an inputted track using fuzzy matching for user input and PCA cluster visualization.
- Uses cosine similarity and custom feature weighting for better musical relevance.

### F1 Data Anaylsis
- My first real data project from a couple years ago
- Some crude and basic visualization and tables drawn from a large kaggle dataset.
- I hope to revisit this soon, to really build it out a lot more.
